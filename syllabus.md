# My Syllabus Heading
## Subheading
*This text will be italicized* **this is bold type** *Don't put spaces* **after the asterisks**

- bullet one
- bullet two

(remember to put a space after the hyphen to make a bullet)

I learned how to do this at the [Digital Humanities Research Institute.](http://dhinstitutes.org/)
